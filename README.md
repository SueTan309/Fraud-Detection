# FRAUD DETECTION 

## PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW: 
This portfolio focuses on detecting whether a payment is fraudulent or not by applying several machine learning techniques. It aims not only to build and evaluate models but also to extract valuable insights from patterns observed in fraudulent payment data.

Additionally, the portfolio includes tuning techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and GridSearch Cross-Validation to optimize hyperparameters and improve model accuracy.
After evaluating the models, the performance comparison between the three will help identify which one delivers the best results for fraud detection.

## File Structure  
- [**Dataset**](https://github.com/SueTan309/Fraud-Detection/blob/master/fraud_detection.csv): The CSV file encompasses all the raw data, providing comprehensive information about various transactions. This includes details such as transaction IDs, timestamps, amounts, locations, and any other relevant attributes necessary for detecting and analyzing fraudulent activities.
- [**Fraud Detection Analysis**](https://github.com/SueTan309/Fraud-Detection/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection%20Analysis.ipynb): The Jupyter Notebook contains the complete workflow, including all processes such as handling missing data, performing data visualization to uncover insights, preparing the data for analysis, and building as well as evaluating machine learning models.
