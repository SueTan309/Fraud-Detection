# FRAUD DETECTION 

### PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW: 
This portfolio focuses on applying several machine learning techniques to detect whether a payment is fraudulent or not. The main objective of the portfolio is to explore and implement
different models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to build, train, and evaluate the models' performance.

Additionally, the portfolio includes tuning techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and GridSearch Cross-Validation to optimize hyperparameters and improve model accuracy.
After evaluating the models, the performance comparison between the three will help identify which one delivers the best results for fraud detection.
